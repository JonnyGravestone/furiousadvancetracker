This screen is subdivided into 5 parts: there are as many types of instruments in \FAT.
\medskip

\begin{itemize}
    \item{PULSE}
    \item{WAVE}
    \item{NOISE}
    \item{KIT/SAMPLE}
    \item{OSCILLATOR}
\end{itemize}\medskip

Each instrument is specialized in playing notes {\bf on a certain channel}.
Remember, the SONG screen is composed of 6 columns.
These 6 columns actually represent each of the 6 channels of the GBA. So,
 \medskip

 \begin{itemize}
    \item{PULSE instruments are specialists in channel 1 and 2: the PU1 and PU2}
    \item{the WAVE instruments are useful for channel 3 only: the WAV channel}
    \item{the NOISE instrument is intended for channel 4: the NOI channel}
    \item{the instruments of type KIT / SAMPLE officiate on channel 5 and 6: the SNA and SNB}
    \item{finally, the OSCILLATOR softly generate a basic sound (sinusoidal, square, triangular or sawtooth)}
 \end{itemize}\medskip

 But \FAT is flexible enough to allow the use of an instrument in a channel that is not dedicated to it:
   The behavior can be surprising ... or inaudible.
   It's up to you to see what you want to produce as sounds.

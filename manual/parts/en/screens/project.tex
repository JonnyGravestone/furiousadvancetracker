\subsubsection{Parameters}

\paragraph{Properties : "Tempo"} Project tempo.

\paragraph{Properties : "Transpose"} Set up all project's transposition.

\paragraph{Properties : "Sample rate"} Sets the sampling speed for samples and oscillators.

\paragraph{Interface : "Keyrepeat"} This parameter is used to set the waiting time between each press of a key.
                                     The larger the value, the slower the interface.

\paragraph{Interface : "Preview"} Set this to YES to instruct \FAT to play the note as it is written.

\paragraph{Interface : "GreedPlay"} If enabled, the GreedPlay forces \FAT to always seek to play the first sequence
                                     available in a set regardless of the line you are on.
                                     Ex: put several sequences (with notes to read) in succession, from line 0 to 5, then position on line 3.
                                     Press START. If greedPlay is enabled, playback will not start from line 3 but from 0.

\paragraph{Management : "New Prj"} Creates a new project.
                                 Beware, unregistered data will be mercilessly erased, crushed, crushed, massacred, mutilated.

\paragraph{Management : "Save PRJ" (sauvegarder)}  Displays the backup screen (cf \hyperref [sec: filesystem] {"FILESYSTEM screen"}).
                                                 This version of \FAT remains experimental in terms of backup management.

\paragraph{Management : "Load PRJ" (charger)} Displays the loading screen (cf \hyperref [sec: filesystem] {"FILESYSTEM screen"}).
                                                 This version of \FAT remains experimental in terms of backup management.

\paragraph{Live : "Buffering"}
Enables or disables buffering in the LIVE screen.
\medskip

\begin{itemize}
    \item{actived, modification of the "volume", "transpose" and "tempo" data only applies when you release button A}
    \item{disabled, these changes are immediately taken into account}
\end{itemize}
\medskip
If you do not want to have a stair effect on the LIVE screen, leave the buffering enabled.
